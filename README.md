# Sums of remainders #

This program calculates sums of all remainders of integers divided by integers smaller than them. This is calculated up to N, such that for all integers the sum is plotted with prime numbers being marked with a red dot and composite numbers with a blue dot.

The summation works as:



For example, summing the remainders for number 5 goes like this
